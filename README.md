An extension of the [(split-stack branch) simple VM](https://github.com/parrt/simple-virtual-machine/tree/split-stack) I did that [shahilahmed converted to Python](https://github.com/shahilahmed/simple-virtual-machine-Python). I added `dumpCodeMemory()` to view code memory and assembly

Branches:

* [master](https://github.com/parrt/simple-virtual-machine-C/tree/master). This is a straight Python port of the [split-stack branch from Java](https://github.com/parrt/simple-virtual-machine/tree/split-stack).
* [c-version] (https://github.com/codyebberson/vm) 
Run:

```bash
$ python Test.py
```
